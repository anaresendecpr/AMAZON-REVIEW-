The analysis aimed to observe the relationship between review, sentiment of helpfulness and Rating of products. It is believed that this way it is possible to understand how the public feels about products and brands. Hypothesis were created and  to decided if they could be accepted or not, we used Python, SQL, and Tableau. 
Python was used to clean and processing the data. Colluns were dropped, null values were treated.
Feature engineering techniques were  applied in order to create new variables to analyse, as sentiment variable, once we are dealing with text analysis. 
Using SQL the data was manipulated, for example the missing observations in the brand colluns were found in some titles and reagreated to the collum brand. Analysis were done in SQL. 
Tableau was used to create visualizations to better analyse the data. 

The biggest observation was that the number of words significantly impacts the product rating and the sentiment of help that the review can bring to a potential customer.
Once reviews are often a key point on customer decision to buy or not an item, we assume that these factors might contribute to the position of a product in Sales Rank.
For clothing and shoes products, reviews will inform if it is true size, if the customer that usually buys Medium should buy one measure up or down, if the material is as it looks on the picture etcâ€¦ 
This analysis also helps us to understand which titles and brands are reviewed the most. Clotting being the biggest category reviewed and with titles in better positions in Sales Rank, as said before it leads us to the conclusion that customers that buy clothes online need helpful reviews to make this decision.
In conclusion the dataset has  a large number of positive reviews, and these products usually have high rate of helpful reviews wich rank better within the sales rank. The customer needs to be stimulated to wright more words, useful words, which helps the public's decision to buy that product or not.
