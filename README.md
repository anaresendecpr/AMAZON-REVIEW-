# AMAZON-REVIEW-
The analysis aimed to observe the relationship between review, sentiment of helpfulness and Rating of products. It is believed that this way it is possible to understand how the public feels about products and brands. Hypothesis were created and  to decided if they could be accepted or not, we used Python, SQL, and Tableau. 
Python was used to clean and processing the data. Colluns were dropped, null values were treated.
Feature engineering techniques were  applied in order to create new variables to analyse, as sentiment variable, once we are dealing with text analysis. 
Using SQL the data was manipulated, for example the missing observations in the brand colluns were found in some titles and reagreated to the collum brand. Analysis were done in SQL. Tableau was used to create visualizations to better analyse the data.
